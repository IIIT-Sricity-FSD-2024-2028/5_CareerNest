#  College Placement & Internship Portal

##  Problem Statement

Campus placement and internship management in colleges involves multiple stakeholders such as candidates, recruiters, alumni, faculty, and the placement cell.  
Currently, much of this process relies on **emails, spreadsheets, messaging apps, and manual coordination**, which leads to:

- Lack of transparency for candidates about application status
- Manual errors in eligibility checking
- Delays in communication between stakeholders
- Difficulty in tracking referrals and recruitment stages
- High coordination overhead for the placement cell

There is a need for a **centralized, structured, and transparent system** that models how placements actually happen in practice, while enforcing institutional rules and providing clear visibility to all stakeholders.

This project aims to model and build a **College Placement & Internship Portal** that reflects real-world placement workflows, roles, rules, and constraints.

##  Identified Actors

The system involves the following actors, each representing a real-world role in the placement process:

- Candidate  
- Recruiter  
- Alumni  
- Placement Cell  
- Faculty (Placement Advisor)

Each actor interacts with the system based on their responsibilities in actual placement workflows.
